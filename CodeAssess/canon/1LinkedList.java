// Write a program that takes a single linked list of integers (from 0 to 10) of positive size N and gives As output the number that occurs the maximum number of times, from the inputted list. The input will be given in one line in the following format. N a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 … an ‘N’ is the size of the list and a1,a2,a3,… an, are the integers present on the list indicating that a1 has a link to a2,a2 has a link to a3 and so on. If more than one number appear the maximum number of times, you should Give as output the greatest one.

// Example

// Case 1: For the input provided as follows: 
// 7 1 5 1 4 9 0 4 

// Output program will be: 
// 4 

// Description: 
// Both 1 and 4 appear the maximum number of times(two times), but 4 is The greatest one out of the two, so the output is 4.

// // Case 2: For the input provide as follows: 
// 7 1 10 0 5 2 3 9 

// Output of the program will be: 10 

// Description: 
// All number appear only once, so you should choose the greatest one that is 10.
