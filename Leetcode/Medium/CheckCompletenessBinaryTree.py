# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

# In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.


# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

# BFS
# Use BFS to do a level order traversal,
# add childrens to the bfs queue,
# until we met the first empty node.

# For a complete binary tree,
# there should not be any node after we met an empty one.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        bfs = [root]
        i = 0
        while bfs[i]:
            bfs.append(bfs[i].left)
            bfs.append(bfs[i].right)
            i += 1
        return not any(bfs[i:])
