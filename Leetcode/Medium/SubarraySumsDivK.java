// Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.

// A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.


// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
// Output: 7
// Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
// [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [5], k = 9
// Output: 0

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
// -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
// 2 <= k <= 104

// Approach: Prefix Sums and Counting
// Intuition
// The problem is based on the concept of using prefix sums to compute the total number of subarrays that are divisible by k. A prefix sum array for nums is another array prefixSum of the same size as nums, such that the value of prefixSum[i] is the sum of all elements of the nums array from index 0 to index i, i.e., nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] + . . . + nums[i].

// The sum of the subarray i + 1 to j (inclusive) is computed by prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i]. Using this, we can count the number of pairs that exist for every pair (i, j) where i < j and (prefixSum[j] - prefix[i]) % k = 0. There are n * (n - 1) / 2 pairs for an array of length n (pick any two from n). As a result, while this will provide the correct answer for every test case, it will take O(n2)O(n^2)O(n 
// 2
//  ) time, indicating that the time limit has been exceeded (TLE).

// The character % is the modulo operator.

// Let's try to use the information with respect to the remainders of every prefix sum and try to optimize the above approach.

// As stated previously, our task is to determine the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and (prefixSum[j] - prefix[i]) % k = 0. This equality can only be true if prefixSum[i] % k = prefixSum[j] % k. We will demonstrate this property.

// We can express any number as number = divisor Ã— quotient + remainder. For example, 13 when divided by 3 can be written as 13 = 3 * 4 + 1. So we can express:
// a) prefixSum[i] as prefixSum[i] = A * k + R0 where A is the quotient and R0 is the remainder when divided by k.
// b) Similarly, prefixSum[j] = B * k + R1 where B is the quotient and R1 is the remainder when divided by k.

// We can write, prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i] = k * (B - A) + (R1 - R0). The first term (k * (B - A)) is divisible by k, so for the entire expression to be divisible by k, R1 - R0 must also be divisible by k. This gives us an equation R1 - R0 = C * k, where C is some integer. Rearranging it yields R1 = C * k + R0. Because the values of R0 and R1 will be between 0 and k - 1, R1 cannot be greater than k. So the only possible value for C is 0, leading to R0 = R1, which proves the above property. If C > 0, then the RHS would be at least k, but as stated the LHS (R1) is between 0 and k - 1.

// Here are two visual examples showing the calculations:

// Let's say a subarray ranging from index 0 to index j has a remainder R when the sum of its elements (prefix sum) is divided by k. Our task now becomes to figure out how many subarrays 0..i exist with i < j having the same remainder R when their prefix sum is divided by k. So, we need to maintain the count of remainders while moving in the array.

// We start with an integer prefixMod = 0 to store the remainder when the sum of the elements of a subarray that start from index 0 is divided by k. We do not need the prefix sum array, since we only need to maintain the count of each remainder (0 to k - 1) so far. To maintain the count of the remainders, we initialize an array modGroups[k], where modGroups[R] stores the number of times R was the remainder so far.

// We iterate over all the elements starting from index 0. We set prefixMod = (prefixMod + num[i] % k + k) % k for each element at index i to find the remainder of the sum of the subarray ranging from index 0 to index i when divided by k. The + k is needed to handle negative numbers. We can then add the number of subarrays previously seen having the same remainder prefixMod to cancel out the remainder. The total number of these arrays is in modGroups[prefixMod]. In the end, we increment the count of modGroups[R] by one to include the current subarray with the remainder R for future matches.

// Till now, we chose some previous subarrays (if they exist) to delete the remainder from the existing array formed till index i when the sum of its elements is divided by k. What if the sum of the elements of the array till index i is divisible by k and we don't need another subarray to delete the remainder?

// To count the complete subarray from index 0 to index i, we also initialize modGroups[0] = 1 at the start so that if a complete subarray from index 0 to the current index is divisible by k, we include the complete array in the count of modGroups[0]. It is set to start with 1 to cover the complete subarray case. For example, let's assume we are index i. Say, we have previously encountered three subarrays from index 0 to some index j where j < i that were divisible by 'k'. Now, assume the sum of elements in the array up to index i is also divisible by k. So, we will have 4 options to form a subarray ending at index i that is divisible by k. Three of these come from choosing the subarrays (resulting in subarray j + 1, .., i that is divisble by k) that were divisble by k and one comes from choosing the complete subarray starting from index 0 till index i.

// Algorithm
// Initialize an integer prefixMod = 0 to store the remainder when the sum of the elements of a array till the current index when divided by k, and the answer variable result = 0 to store the number of subarrays divisible by k.
// Initialize an array, modGroups[k] where modGroup[R] stores the number of subarrays encountered with the sum of elements having a remainder R when divided by k. Set modGroups[0] = 1.
// Iterate over all the elements of num.
// For each index i, compute the prefix modulo as prefixMod = (prefixMod + num[i] % k + k) % k. We take modulo twice in (prefixMod + num[i] % k + k) % k to remove negative numbers since num[i] can be a negative number and the sum prefixMod + nums[i] % k can turn out to be negative. To remove the negative number we add k to make it positive and then takes its modulo again with k.
// Add the number of subarrays encountered till now that have the same remainder to the result: result = result + modGroups[prefixMod].
// In the end, we include the remainder of the subarray in the modGroups, i.e., modGroups[prefixMod] = modGroups[prefixMod] + 1 for future matches.
// Return result.
