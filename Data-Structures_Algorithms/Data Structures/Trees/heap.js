// A heap is a tree where every parent is greater than its children ( for max-heaps ) or they are smaller than their children ( for min-heaps)
//A Max heap( and min heap) is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0]. Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node.
//Arr[(2*i)+1] Returns the left child node. Arr[(2*i)+2] Returns the right child node. Operations on Max Heap (and min heap) include:
//getMax(): It returns the root element of Max Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
//extractMax(): Removes the maximum element from MaxHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n)
//as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
//insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree.
//If new key is smaller than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
